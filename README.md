Hello!

This page will be for all my sources for media files etc. that I used in my site.

In `index.html` you are greeted with a video. That video is from D4DJ: First Mix, available on [https://www.crunchyroll.com/](https://www.crunchyroll.com/) for viewing. For the individual source I used: [https://www.pinterest.com/pin/206321226673804275/](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/206321226673804275/).

For the fixed image that you see at the bottom right of your screen while the site is in focus—it’s from the anime *Aharen-san wa Hakarenai* (I think). The picture was taken from [https://litterbox.catbox.moe/](https://litterbox.catbox.moe/).

All the images in the music tab all have links to their YouTube Music uploads by their creators. That’s how I got them—using YouTube Music and going to their songs/albums.

In the computer tab, the desktop computer image displayed at the bottom left of the screen is from here: [https://www.transparentpng.com/details/clipart-computer-monitor-and-case-animation-drawing-accessories-desk-software\_28442.html](https://www.transparentpng.com/details/clipart-computer-monitor-and-case-animation-drawing-accessories-desk-software_28442.html).
The "I love open software" image was generated by ChatGPT. All credit goes to OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. Come find me anti-AI artists!!!!!!!!! Ain’t got shit on my sillyness!!

The picture displayed top right is my drawing. Credits to me (can’t copyright me today).

On the socials page, the Spotify icon was taken from here: [https://www.pinterest.com/pin/839428818040817502/](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/839428818040817502/), the Last.fm icon was taken from here—I just cropped it a bit: [https://www.iconsdb.com/black-icons/lastfm-icon.html](https://www.iconsdb.com/black-icons/lastfm-icon.html).
The AniList icon was taken from here: [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File\:AniList\_logo.svg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:AniList_logo.svg).
The Discord icon was taken from here: [https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/discord_3670325](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/discord_3670325)

For the collage on the farewell page, the column most leftward—both images are mine (drawings). The rest are from these links:

I don’t promise that these are the original creators of said media that is posted. These are just the places I got these pieces of media from.
